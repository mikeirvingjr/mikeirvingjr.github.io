                        <p>
                            Blazor was learned while working for Hawcroft. We were waiting for the 
                            updates Microsoft Maui was going to bring to Xamarin Forms; however, 
                            the updates were not going to be production ready for a while.  So, 
                            this called for using a combination of Blazor Server and WebAssembly
                            so we could use an embedded SQLite database on the client. Of course
                            the database used EntityFramework and was encrypted just in case the
                            database was compromised.

                            I enjoyed React because it could be configured to use TSX TypeScript 
                            files instead of JSX JavaScript. I have a C++ background and this was
                            one of the features I found lacking within JavaScript; it not being a 
                            strongly typed language.  But alas, TypeScript aims to fix that.
